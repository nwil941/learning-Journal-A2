In this assignment I found it easy to complete the speudo code section.
I completed this first as I though it would help me brainstorm for how the game worked.
I then completed the functions, the playturn function I struggled with how to get the currentplayers current position.
The roll dice function seemed pretty straight forward. I did some research on different ways this could be completed and chose one.
